# Iowa Data Analysis 

Performed more complex analysis using the full iowa dataset. In contrast to directly wrote SQL queries using the magic %%sql cells, we will be directly connecting to the database and running queries through the Python database client. This is how the magic %%sql cells are implemented under the covers anyways.  

We will also be using DuckDB, a new database system designed for analytics. It is very similar to the SQLite database we have used in the past, however it is must faster when analyzing the entire dataset.
